# How Should a Film Production Company Invest its Capital?

## Questions

Looking at the film production space, it's easy to be mesmerized by individual box office statistics: MCU movies, for example, can make over a billion dollars worldwide. So does that mean Action and Adventure movies are the most profitable avenues for investment. Or do these numbers conceal unacceptable levels of risk and expenditure? To answer this question, I looked at two metrics: 
1. The market size of various film genres
2. Their expected returns on investment.

A film company can maximize its profits both by making films that serve large markets as well as by tapping smaller markets that have a high Expected Return on Investment. In this study, I calculated the market size of film genres by totaling the box office grosses of films belonging to each genre and I calculated each genre's Expected Return On Investment by totaling the box office grosses and production budgets and dividing their difference by the production budget total. Assuming that we are working from a data set that is an unbiased representation of the film industry, the Expected Return on Investment accounts for the relative likelihood of successes and failures by measuring the performance of each genre as a whole.

In addition to calculating market size and ROI for genres as a whole, I also looked at the differences in market share and profitability for productions of different sizes, mostly focusing on seven, eight, and nine figure productions. 

## Methodology

To perform this study, I used three data sets. The first data set, from the-numbers.com, includes the production budgets, and domestic and worldwide grosses for almost six thousand movies from 1915 to 2020. I used two additional databases, TheMovieDB and IMDB, to find genre information for almost a third of these films, and limited my sample to only movies made from 2000 to 2020. 

In order to identify and correct for bias in this smaller data set (the set of movies for which genre information was available), I identified the factors by which the gross and ROI statistics had been scaled--both for the data set as a whole and for productions of different sizes. Overall, the reduced data set over-represented movies with higher ROIs--it's likely that because they were more successful they were more likely to have genre information attached in the other databases. By dividing the gross and ROI statistics for each segment of the data by the appropriate scaling factor, I was able to correct for my data set's bias towards profitable films, yielding a more realistic Expected Return on Investment.
